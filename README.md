# CEdev
This is my use of the CEdev toolchain for the TI84 Plus CE Graphing Calculator, which can be found here:
- https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain
- https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain/index.html#
- The toolchain allows for using C/C++ on the TI84 Plus CE Graphing Calculator and includes many libraries to experiment with.
